# Horiseon Code Refactor

Horiseon Code Refactor is Homework 1 for UW Coding Bootcamp. The objective for this assignment was to take the existing HTML file and refactor it to make it more semantic, without changing how the page displayed.

All changes to the original code are documented in notes in the index.thml and style.css files.

I generated a Lighthouse report, which is found within Assets/Lighthouse.
